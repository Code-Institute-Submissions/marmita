#Marmita Project (Milestone Project | Code Institute)

This project is a website for a small start-up that sells frozen homemade food. 
In this website the user can see the food options and prices, check some videos, send their order and find the contact details to send food suggestions or inquires. They can also see the companies mission, vision and values.


##UX

This website is intended for anyone who wants to eat healthy and don’t have time or energy to prepare homemade meals. On the website the user can find out what is the company’s purpose, choose their meals and find the company’s contact details.

User Stories

1. Millena.
She is a young adult who’s just moved out her parents’ house. She is still learning how to cook, but she wants to eat real food. She works full time and doesn’t have much time to practice her cooking abilities at the moment.

 
2. Jessica
She is living with her fiancé. He’s a great cook, but he works full time and is also finishing his master degree, so no time to cook. Jessica on the other hand, is not working or studying but she hates cooking. She wants to lose some weight and she figured it out that she won’t if she keeps having sandwiches for lunch and dinner.


3. Renata
She has 2 sons, is single and works full time. She is really stressed because she can settle for some instant noodles, but she can’t do this to her children. When she gets home she needs to clean the house, do the laundry, give her boys a bath and so on. She needs some help!


4. Flavio
He is 20 years old, works full time and is really overweight. He still lives with his parents but most of the time he ends up eating McDonalds instead of bringing homemade lunch to work. He thinks that he might start to eat heathier if he is paying for the food.
